# Railway Redeploy Instructions

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status
I can see in your Railway dashboard that you have the dropdown menu open for the ABCOM-TRADER service.

## ðŸš€ To Trigger Redeploy:

### Step 1: Click "Latest deploy"
In the dropdown menu that's currently open, click on **"Latest deploy"**

This will:
- Trigger a new deployment with your updated configuration files
- Use the new `railway.toml` and `backend/nixpacks.toml` files
- Properly build only the backend folder (fixing the monorepo issue)

### Step 2: Monitor the Deployment
After clicking "Latest deploy":
1. Watch the deployment logs in real-time
2. Look for successful build completion
3. The build should now work because we fixed the monorepo configuration

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables (While Deploying)
While the deployment is running, add your environment variables:
1. In the same dropdown menu, click **"Add Variable"**
2. Add all 22 variables from the `railway-env-variables.txt` file
3. This can be done while the deployment is in progress

## âœ… Expected Result:
With the fixed configuration, the deployment should succeed and show:
- âœ… Build completed successfully
- âœ… Application started
- âœ… Health check passing

## ðŸ”§ If Still Failing:
If the deployment still fails after the configuration fix, we can:
1. Check the new error logs
2. Adjust the configuration further
3. Use alternative deployment methods

**Click "Latest deploy" now to start the fixed deployment!** ðŸš€
