```

### Navigation Structure

**Primary Navigation Philosophy:** Banking app familiarity with simplified dashboard approach
- **Desktop**: Persistent left sidebar with main content area (dashboard-style layout)
- **Tablet**: Collapsible sidebar maintaining same visual hierarchy
- **Mobile**: Bottom navigation bar with vertically stacked content

**Core Navigation Elements:**
- **Account Overview** (home icon) - Always visible balance and algorithm status
- **Performance** (chart icon) - Simple progress tracking and trade history
- **Authorization** (clock icon) - Time-based trading control with countdown
- **Settings** (gear icon) - User preferences and help resources
- **Emergency Stop** (large red button) - Persistent top-right placement across all screens

**Secondary Navigation Strategy:**
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced features behind "Tell me more" links
- **Context-Sensitive Options**: Relevant controls appear based on current screen
- **Educational Integration**: Every navigation choice includes learning opportunities

- **Consistent Emergency Access**: Red stop button maintains prominence across all screen sizes

**Breadcrumb Strategy:** 
- **Minimal Implementation**: Only for deep settings navigation (Settings > Notifications > Email)
- **Educational Context**: Breadcrumbs include helpful explanations ("Settings help you control how the bot communicates with you")
- **Single-Level Focus**: Most functionality stays at top level to avoid navigation anxiety

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

**Information Overload Prevention:**
- **Progressive Reveal System**: Dashboard sections can be collapsed/expanded based on user comfort level
- **Guided Tours**: First-time users get step-by-step introduction to each interface element
- **Focus Mode**: Option to hide non-essential elements during active trading periods
- **Adaptive Complexity**: Interface complexity increases gradually as user demonstrates competency

**Mobile Navigation Optimization:**
- **Adaptive UI Priority**: Screen real estate automatically prioritizes most critical elements
- **Contextual Navigation**: Bottom nav items change based on current user task
- **Gesture Fallbacks**: Swipe gestures provide alternative navigation when screen space is limited
- **Emergency Access**: Red stop button adapts size and position based on available screen space

**Algorithm Communication Clarity:**
- **Structured Conversation Flows**: Algorithm responses follow predictable patterns to set expectations
- **AI Limitations Messaging**: Clear indicators when algorithm reaches limits of explanation capability
- **Response Categories**: Algorithm messages clearly labeled as "Market Update," "Decision Explanation," or "Performance Summary"
- **Fallback Responses**: Graceful handling when algorithm cannot provide specific explanations

**Regulatory Compliance Integration:**
- **Dual-Layer Disclosure**: Simple explanations paired with expandable legal language
- **Contextual Legal Reminders**: Risk disclosures appear at decision points without disrupting flow
- **Audit Trail Integration**: All user interactions logged for regulatory compliance
- **Professional Mode Legal**: Professional toggle includes more detailed regulatory language

**Performance & Technical Resilience:**
- **Graceful Degradation**: Interface remains functional even if real-time updates fail
- **Offline Indicators**: Clear visual feedback when data connections are interrupted
- **Efficient Data Streaming**: Optimized WebSocket usage to prevent performance issues
- **Backup Information Display**: Cached data shown when live updates unavailable

**User Behavior Safeguards:**
- **Escalating Risk Reminders**: Risk warnings become more prominent with longer authorization periods
- **Mandatory Cooling-Off**: Forced breaks after significant losses or extended trading sessions
- **Independent Decision Checkpoints**: Periodic prompts requiring user to make decisions without algorithm input
- **Educational Progression Gates**: Advanced features unlock only after demonstrating understanding

    K --> L{Quiz Passed?}
    L -->|No| M[Review & Retry]
    M --> K
    L -->|Yes| N[Risk Disclosure]
    
    N --> O[User Acknowledgment]
    O --> P[Paper Trading Tutorial]
    P --> Q[Practice Authorization]
    Q --> R[Paper Trading Session]
    R --> S[Tutorial Complete]
    S --> G[Main Dashboard]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- User fails comprehension quiz multiple times → Additional educational resources provided
- User abandons onboarding mid-process → Progress saved, gentle re-engagement email sent
- Technical issues during paper trading → Graceful fallback to demo mode
- User tries to skip educational sections → Blocked with explanation of importance
- Regulatory disclosure not acknowledged → Cannot proceed until explicit consent given

**Notes:** Onboarding flow prioritizes education over speed, with multiple checkpoints to ensure user understanding before allowing real money trading.

### Express Authorization Flow

**User Goal:** Grant trading permission to SmartTrade AI algorithm for specific time period

**Entry Points:** Main dashboard authorization button, expired authorization renewal, post-login prompt

**Success Criteria:** User successfully authorizes trading with full understanding of risks and time limits

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Authorization Request] --> B[Current Status Check]
    B --> C{Already Authorized?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Show Remaining Time]
    C -->|No| E[Time Selection Screen]
    
    E --> F[1 Hour Option]
    E --> G[4 Hour Option]
    E --> H[1 Day Option]
    E --> I[1 Week Option]
    
    F --> J[Risk Reminder: $9 max loss]
    G --> J
    H --> K[Risk Reminder: $18 max loss]
    I --> L[Risk Reminder: $27 max loss]
    
    J --> M[Confirmation Dialog]

    F --> G[Close Open Positions]
    G --> H[Revoke Authorization]
    H --> I[Stop Algorithm]
    I --> J[Send Notifications]
    
    J --> K[Display Confirmation]
    K --> L["Trading Stopped Successfully"]
    L --> M[Show Final Account Status]
    M --> N[Offer Support Options]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- Network failure during emergency stop → Local state change with retry mechanism
- Positions cannot be closed immediately → Market order placement with user notification
- Stop pressed accidentally → Quick restart option available for 60 seconds
- Multiple stop requests → Idempotent handling prevents duplicate actions
- Stop during market closure → Confirmation that no active trading to stop

**Notes:** Emergency stop prioritizes speed and certainty, with immediate visual feedback and comprehensive status reporting.

### Loss Recovery Flow

**User Goal:** Understand and recover from trading losses while learning from the experience

**Entry Points:** Daily loss limit reached, weekly loss limit hit, significant single trade loss, user panic

**Success Criteria:** User feels supported, understands what happened, and is prepared to continue or take a break

#### Flow Diagram
