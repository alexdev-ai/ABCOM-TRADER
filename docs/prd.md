# Autonomous Trading Bot Product Requirements Document (PRD)

*Document Status: In Progress*
*Created by: Product Manager (John)*
*Date: January 10, 2025*

---

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Enable a single non-technical user to successfully operate an autonomous trading bot with $90 starting capital
- Achieve consistent positive returns (5-15% monthly growth) while maintaining strict risk controls (max $9 daily loss)
- Provide ultra-simple interface comprehensible by a 14-year-old with no trading jargon
- Implement express authorization system ensuring regulatory compliance and user control
- Demonstrate multi-asset trading capabilities (stocks, ETFs, crypto) with adaptive strategy selection
- Build user confidence through educational transparency and paper trading validation
- Validate technical proof-of-concept for Alpaca API integration and automated trading systems

### Background Context

The autonomous trading bot addresses a critical gap in the market for small-capital retail traders who want to participate in algorithmic trading but are excluded by high minimum account requirements ($25K+) and complex interfaces. Current solutions either require substantial capital, advanced technical knowledge, or lack the adaptive intelligence needed for small account optimization.

This product leverages the Alpaca API's commission-free trading infrastructure to create an accessible entry point for automated trading. The system's unique value lies in its combination of sophisticated multi-asset analysis with an interface so simple that a teenager can understand and authorize trading decisions. By implementing express authorization intervals and comprehensive risk controls, the product maintains regulatory compliance while enabling true autonomous operation.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The interface balances radical simplicity with professional credibility - designed to make trading accessible while maintaining user trust in financial decisions. Every element uses familiar metaphors (green = good/profit, red = bad/loss) with clear visual feedback. The design prioritizes trust-building through transparency, showing the bot's "thinking process" in conversational yet respectful language. Users should feel like they're working with a knowledgeable financial advisor who explains things clearly, not a complex trading platform.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **One-Click Authorization**: Single large button to grant trading permission with clear time selection and risk reminders
- **Dual-Mode Explanations**: Friendly conversational tone with optional "Professional Mode" toggle for formal language
- **Traffic Light System**: Green (safe/go), Yellow (caution), Red (stop/danger) for all status indicators with text labels
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced information hidden behind "Tell me more" links with regulatory disclaimers
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Every action explained in plain English with required risk acknowledgments
- **Emergency Controls**: Large, prominent "STOP TRADING" button always visible with immediate effect
- **Regulatory Integration**: Friendly explanations paired with required legal disclaimers and risk warnings

### Core Screens and Views

- **Dashboard**: Simple account balance, today's profit/loss, bot status with clear indicators and professional mode toggle
- **Authorization Screen**: Time selection (1hr, 4hr, 1day) with risk explanations and regulatory disclaimers
- **Trade History**: List view with simple explanations ("Made $3 buying Apple stock") plus detailed view option
- **Paper Trading Mode**: Identical to live trading with prominent "PRACTICE MODE" banners and progress tracking
- **Settings/Help**: Educational tooltips, language mode toggle, and comprehensive help system
- **Onboarding Flow**: Step-by-step tutorial with comprehension validation and user testing integration
- **Risk Disclosure**: Dedicated screen for regulatory compliance with clear acknowledgment requirements

### Accessibility: WCAG AA+

The interface exceeds WCAG AA standards with enhanced support for cognitive disabilities, high contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and text scaling up to 200%. All critical information is conveyed through multiple channels (color, text, icons, audio cues) with special consideration for users making financial decisions.

### Branding

Professional yet approachable design that balances educational simplicity with financial credibility. Uses calming colors (blues, greens) with clear typography and subtle visual hierarchy. Avoids both "get rich quick" aesthetics and overly sterile financial interfaces. Includes trust indicators (security badges, regulatory compliance notices) while maintaining friendly, accessible appearance.

### Data Visualization Requirements

**Simple Financial Charts:**
- **Account Balance Trend**: Large, simple line chart showing account growth over time with clear green (up) and red (down) sections
- **Daily Profit/Loss Bar**: Single horizontal bar showing today's performance with dollar amounts and percentage in large, clear text
- **Win/Loss Ratio**: Simple pie chart or progress bar showing successful vs unsuccessful trades with emoji indicators (😊 for wins, 😞 for losses)
- **Trading Activity Timeline**: Vertical timeline showing recent trades with simple icons (📈 buy, 📉 sell) and plain English descriptions

**Visual Design Principles:**
- **No Complex Technical Charts**: Avoid candlestick charts, technical indicators, or complex financial visualizations
- **Large Text and Numbers**: All financial figures displayed in large, readable fonts with clear currency formatting
- **Color Coding**: Consistent green for positive, red for negative, blue for neutral/informational
- **Progress Indicators**: Use familiar progress bars and percentage displays rather than abstract charts
- **Contextual Explanations**: Every chart includes plain English explanation ("This shows how your money has grown over time")

**Interactive Elements:**
- **Hover Explanations**: Simple tooltips explaining what each data point means
- **Drill-Down Capability**: Click on chart elements to see more detail in conversational format
- **Time Period Selection**: Simple buttons for "Today", "This Week", "This Month" views
- **Comparison Context**: Show performance against simple benchmarks ("You did better than keeping money in savings")

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive+

Web-based responsive interface optimized for desktop and tablet use with enhanced mobile responsiveness. Primary focus on desktop/tablet for optimal trading decision-making, but fully functional mobile experience for monitoring and basic controls. Compatible with modern browsers with progressive enhancement and accessibility features across all screen sizes.
