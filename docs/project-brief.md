## Executive Summary

An intelligent autonomous trading bot that leverages the Alpaca API to identify and execute high-return trading opportunities across multiple asset classes (stocks, ETFs, crypto) with minimal human intervention. The system dynamically recommends and switches between optimal trading strategies (momentum, mean reversion, breakout patterns) based on real-time market conditions, targeting consistent daily profits above market averages.

**Primary Problem:** Individual traders with limited capital ($90 budget) struggle to monitor markets continuously and often miss profitable opportunities due to human limitations in reaction speed, emotional decision-making, and the inability to maintain 24/7 market surveillance across multiple asset classes and strategies.

**Target Market:** Individual retail traders with existing funded Alpaca accounts and limited trading capital who want to maximize returns through automated, adaptive trading strategies while maintaining control over risk parameters and trading authorization.

**Key Value Proposition:** Delivers autonomous trading capabilities that can identify the best opportunities across stocks, ETFs, and crypto, dynamically switch between proven strategies, and consistently generate profits above daily market averages - all optimized for small account sizes starting with $90 capital.

## Problem Statement

**Current State & Pain Points:**
Individual traders with limited capital face multiple compounding challenges that prevent them from maximizing their trading potential:

- **Capital Constraints**: With only $90 starting capital, traditional diversification strategies are impossible, forcing concentration risk
- **Market Surveillance Limitations**: Cannot monitor multiple asset classes (stocks, ETFs, crypto) simultaneously across different time zones and market hours
- **Strategy Selection Paralysis**: Difficulty determining which trading strategy (momentum, mean reversion, breakout) is optimal for current market conditions
- **Emotional Decision Making**: Fear, greed, and FOMO lead to poor entry/exit timing and strategy abandonment during drawdowns
- **Opportunity Cost**: Missing profitable setups due to sleep, work, or other commitments during market hours
- **Analysis Overload**: Overwhelmed by the need to analyze technical indicators, news, and market sentiment across multiple assets

**Impact Quantification:**
- Average retail trader underperforms market by 3-8% annually due to emotional trading and poor timing
- Small account traders often lose 50-80% of capital within first year due to overtrading and lack of systematic approach
- Manual monitoring limits traders to 1-3 positions maximum, missing diversification benefits
- Delayed reaction to market moves can cost 2-5% per trade in missed profits or increased losses

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**
- **Professional Trading Platforms**: Require $25K+ minimum and complex setup beyond beginner capabilities
- **Basic Trading Bots**: Use single strategies without adaptation to changing market conditions
- **Signal Services**: Require manual execution and don't account for individual capital constraints
- **Robo-Advisors**: Focus on long-term investing, not active trading for quick returns

**Urgency & Importance:**
The current market environment presents unique opportunities for algorithmic trading due to increased volatility and the availability of commission-free trading through Alpaca. Small account traders need immediate access to institutional-level automation to compete effectively and grow their capital before inflation and opportunity costs erode their purchasing power.

## Proposed Solution

**Core Concept & Approach:**
An adaptive autonomous trading bot that intelligently selects between day trading and swing trading strategies based on real-time market opportunities, account size constraints, and regulatory limitations. The system continuously analyzes market conditions across stocks, ETFs, and crypto to identify the highest probability setups while automatically managing risk and compliance.

**Key Differentiators from Existing Solutions:**

1. **Adaptive Strategy Selection**: Unlike static bots, the system dynamically chooses between:
   - **Day Trading Mode**: For high-volatility, clear directional moves when PDT rules allow
   - **Swing Trading Mode**: For larger moves over 2-10 days when overnight risk is acceptable
   - **Scalping Mode**: For micro-movements during high-volume periods

2. **Small Account Optimization**: Specifically designed for accounts under $25K:
   - Intelligent PDT rule management (max 3 day trades per 5-day period)
   - Position sizing optimized for $90+ accounts
   - Fractional share trading where available
   - Risk management scaled to account size

3. **Multi-Asset Intelligence**: Scans and trades across:
   - **Stocks**: Focus on high-volume, liquid names with predictable patterns
   - **ETFs**: Sector rotation and momentum plays
   - **Crypto**: 24/7 market opportunities with higher volatility potential

4. **Opportunity-Driven Execution**: The bot prioritizes the best available setup regardless of asset class or timeframe, ensuring capital is always deployed in the highest probability trade.

**High-Level Vision:**
The system acts as a "digital day trader" that never sleeps, never gets emotional, and can simultaneously monitor hundreds of opportunities across multiple markets. It learns from each trade to improve strategy selection and adapts to changing market conditions automatically.

**Autonomous Operation with User Oversight:**
The system balances full automation with regulatory compliance through **Express Authorization Intervals**:
- **Authorization Windows**: User grants trading permission for specific time periods (1 hour, 4 hours, 1 day, 1 week)
- **Automatic Pause**: Bot stops trading when authorization expires, requiring user renewal
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Alerts user of significant trades, profits/losses, and authorization expiration
- **Emergency Controls**: Instant kill switch and position liquidation available at any time
- **Audit Trail**: Complete log of all decisions and trades for user review and compliance

**Why This Solution Will Succeed:**
- **Technology Advantage**: Leverages Alpaca's real-time data and execution infrastructure
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Built-in PDT rule management, express authorization system, and risk controls
- **Capital Efficiency**: Maximizes limited capital through intelligent opportunity selection
- **Continuous Learning**: Improves performance through backtesting and live trading feedback
- **User Control**: Maintains human oversight through authorization intervals and configurable risk parameters

### PM Handoff

This Project Brief provides the full context for the Autonomous Trading Bot project. Please start in 'PRD Generation Mode', review the brief thoroughly to work with the user to create the PRD section by section as the template indicates, asking for any necessary clarification or suggesting improvements.

**Key Focus Areas for PRD**:
- Detailed technical requirements for risk management systems
- User interface specifications for 14-year-old comprehension level
- Integration requirements with Alpaca API
- Express authorization system implementation
- Educational transparency features
- Paper trading mode specifications

The risk assessment above should be heavily incorporated into the PRD's non-functional requirements and system design considerations.
