## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

### **Issue 1: Missing Core Session Management Stories**
**Severity**: 🔴 **CRITICAL**

**Current Sprint 3 Composition** (Only 4 stories):
- ✅ ABC-34: Transaction History (Carryover from Sprint 2)
- ✅ ABC-35: Risk Management System (Carryover from Sprint 2)  
- ✅ ABC-36: Automated Testing Suite (Carryover from Sprint 2)
- ✅ ABC-40: Session Termination and Automatic Controls (New)

**Missing Essential Stories** (Not assigned to any sprint):
- ❌ **ABC-37**: Trading Session Frontend Components (13 pts) - **CRITICAL**
- ❌ **ABC-38**: Session History and Analytics Dashboard (8 pts) - **CRITICAL**
- ❌ **ABC-39**: Session-Integrated Trading Interface (8 pts) - **CRITICAL**

### **Impact**: 
Without ABC-37, ABC-38, and ABC-39, Sprint 3 cannot deliver the core session management functionality. The current sprint composition focuses on secondary features while missing the primary Sprint 3 objectives.
